# NoRisk Client issues

Submit any bugs / issues you encounter or feature requests you'd like to share.
Here are some general rules:
- Check if a similar issue already exists, and if so do not open a new
one (remember that you can also comment on existing issues to add more
information / detail)
- Use the correct tags
- Give as much detail as possible, in case of a crash this means including the
  crash log
- This repository is meant exclusively for the client itself, issues for the
installer should be opened [there](https://github.com/HGLabor/client-installer-rs/issues).
