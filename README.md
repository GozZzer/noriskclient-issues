# NoRiskClient issues

Submit any bugs / issues you encounter or feature requests you'd like to share.
Here are some general rules:
- Check if a similar issue already exists, and if so do not open a new
one (remember that you can also comment on existing issues to add more
information / detail; if a feature request was closed it was purposely rejected
by us)
- Use the correct labels
- Give as much detail as possible, in case of a crash this means including the
crash log
